#### Integration Layer - Power Automate

##### Core Workflows & System Integrations
```
Automated Workflows
├── Issue routing based on category
├── Email notifications to citizens
├── Escalation for overdue issues
├── Daily digest to department heads
├── Photo/video processing to Azure Blob Storage
├── Automatic image compression and optimisation
└── System Integrations (detailed below)
```

##### Existing Council System Integrations

| System | Integration Method | Data Flow | Frequency |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Dynamics 365 CRM** | REST API | Bi-directional citizen records sync | Real-time |
| **ESRI ArcGIS** | REST API | Location validation & mapping | On submission |
| **Confirm Asset Management** | SOAP/XML | Create work orders for issues | Every 15 mins |
| **SAP Finance** | Flat file SFTP | Cost tracking for resolutions | Daily batch |
| **Exchange/Outlook** | Graph API | Email notifications & calendaring | Real-time |
| **Active Directory** | Graph API | Staff authentication & roles | On login |

##### Integration Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**High-Risk Integrations**:

1. **Dynamics 365 CRM Bi-directional Sync**
   - *Risk*: Data conflicts when citizen updates occur simultaneously in both systems
   - *Mitigation*: Implement "last write wins" with audit trail, consider master data management
   - *API Limits*: 6,000 requests per user/5 minutes - implement throttling
   - *Fallback*: Queue changes in Dataverse for batch retry if API unavailable

2. **Confirm Asset Management (Legacy SOAP)**
   - *Risk*: No modern REST API, SOAP/XML prone to schema changes
   - *Mitigation*: Build abstraction layer with transformation maps
   - *Known Issues*: 30-second timeout on complex queries
   - *Fallback*: Email notification to team with CSV attachment

3. **SAP Finance (File-based)**
   - *Risk*: File format changes, SFTP connectivity issues
   - *Mitigation*: Schema validation, file versioning, secure key management
   - *Error Handling*: Retain files for 30 days, alerting on failed transfers

**Integration Approach**:
- Power Automate handles all orchestration with Azure Service Bus for resilience
  - *Why Service Bus over alternatives*: Built-in dead letter queues, automatic retry policies, and native Power Platform connectors. Unlike Event Grid (event-driven only) or Storage Queues (basic features), Service Bus provides enterprise messaging patterns crucial for government-grade reliability
- Implement circuit breaker pattern (fail fast after 3 attempts)
- Azure Application Insights for end-to-end monitoring
- Integration Design Document deliverable by Sprint 2

#### Analytics - Power BI Embedded

## 7. Risk Management & Addressing Specific Concerns (1 minute)

### Addressing Brief-Specific Risks

#### "Stretched Staff & Lack of Direction"
- **Risk**: Team burnout, project failure
- **Mitigation**: 
  - PwC leads initially, gradual handover
  - Clear roadmap and priorities
  - Quick wins to build momentum

#### "Rarely Used Low-Code in Practice"
- **Risk**: Theoretical knowledge, practical gaps
- **Mitigation**:
  - Hands-on workshops from day 1
  - Pair programming on real features
  - Sandbox environment for experimentation

#### "Inexperienced and Unconvinced of Agile"
- **Risk**: Team lacks Agile experience and is skeptical of its value
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with "Agile-lite" - focus on demos not ceremonies
  - Provide Agile coaching and training alongside development
  - Show value through bi-weekly working software
  - Adapt Agile to fit government governance structures

### Political & Reputational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Launch failure scrutiny** | Councillor criticism, media attention | Medium | Soft launch with 1,000 pilot users first |
| **Data breach** | Public trust collapse, ICO investigation | Low | UK data residency, penetration testing, cyber insurance |
| **Accessibility complaints** | Legal action, disability groups criticism | Low | WCAG 2.1 AA testing every sprint |
| **Service inequity** | "Digital divide" headlines | Medium | Library kiosks, phone channel retained |
| **Budget overrun** | Committee scrutiny, project cancellation | Low | Fixed-price contract options, phase gates |

**Key Message to Leadership**: "We protect the council's reputation through pilot testing, UK-only data hosting, and maintaining non-digital channels"

### Operational Risk Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Low citizen adoption | High | Medium | Multi-channel marketing, user testing |
| Technical skill gaps | Medium | High | Intensive training, ongoing support |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Phased approach, thorough testing |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Clear governance, MoSCoW prioritisation |
